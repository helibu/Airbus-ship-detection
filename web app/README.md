# Web app

## Web progress
We have completed a web app framework, it can upload the images and predict the ship existence. The model used is the pretrained ResNet50 in model part. The accuracy for training is 92.5% and for validation is about 93%.



## Website 
Our website on AWS beanstalk.
http://shipdetection.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
And we have applied for a domain name, http://www.shipdetection.com/
